# Ideally we would use 'check' tests rather than 'lit' tests for as many tests
# as possible, to allow for compilation on host machines and test execution on
# other platforms (with build system support for filtering by target/driver).
# However, 'check' tests are limited to single functions that take no arguments
# and return no results, while these tests are specifically interested in
# testing such structural properties of programs.
