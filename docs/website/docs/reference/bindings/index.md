# API bindings

IREE offers specialized sets of bindings for running compiled programs from
various languages or with specific APIs:

* [Runtime C API](./c-api.md)
* [Compiler and runtime Python bindings](./python.md)
* [Runtime TensorFlow Lite bindings](./tensorflow-lite.md)

TODO: link to the [Depending on IREE guide](../../guides/depending-on-iree.md)
(and refresh language around "running compiled programs" to cover compiler and
runtime)
